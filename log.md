# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Updated personal website with graphically interesting pictures, a darker brown bottom navbar, and border radius on two of the pics to make things less boxy.
2. Created the finance-playground repository. Created a simple python file that basically does the PMT function in excel for installment loans.

**Thoughts:** Liking the new website design a lot. In terms of future improvements, I could see adding a 'contact me' form, a blog, and a virtual art art gallery. I'm also excited to formalize my financial knowledge using coding. (Writing a useful program is a good way to ensure you really understand the math.)

2. [amortization_schedule.py](https://github.com/lecerick/finance-playground/blob/main/amortization_schedule.py)

### Day 1: August 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added a very basic discounting function to the AmSchedule class in finance-playground.

**Thoughts**: Introducing compounding conventions could be a good way to spice up the AmSchedule. I'm less familiar with semi-annual discounting (bond markets) than monthly (mortgage markets), so that could be a learning opportunity. Also [daycount conventions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daycount.asp) (30/360 vs. 30/365 vs. actual/360 vs. actual/365 vs. actual/actual).

### Day 2: August 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Forked the #100-Days-Of-Code repo.

**Thoughts** Recording my progress in the form of this log is going to be helpful, especially if I stall at any point and need to look back on prior thoughts for inspiration. I also spent some time looking through other github users' logs to see what they're working on, and that's a good source of ideas too!
